### Step 3: Working with Raw and Stage Entities - Data Model Developer Tasks

#### Adding a New [Raw](../metadatamodel/zones/raw.md#entity-definition) Entity

1. Click on "Add Raw" and select the source system (e.g., AdventureWorks).
2. Categorize the data by specifying the Data Product and Module.
3. Choose the entity you want to add and click "Add."
4. Optionally, you can add a custom SQL query for the entity (if implemented).

#### [Generating](../generator/generator.md) the [Stage](../metadatamodel/zones/stage.md#entity-definition)

1. Ensure that the Stage generation settings are correctly configured in the settings.
2. Click on the "Generate Stage" button to create the Stage from the [Raw](../metadatamodel/zones/raw.md#entity-definition) entity.

### Step 4: Automation Developer Tasks

As an Automation Developer, you can leverage Base Definitions and Generate/Templates features to automate data warehouse workflows on your preferred target platform.

### Step 5: Working with [Core](../metadatamodel/zones/core.md#entity-definition) Entities - Data Model Developer Tasks

1. Add a new Core entity and define its display name, explanation, purpose, tags, and parameters (key/value store).
2. Union multiple entities from the Stage to create the Core entity.
3. Include or exclude columns as needed for the Core entity.
4. Set target names, business keys, attribute types, data types (from Base Definitions), and unit attribute names for the included columns.
5. Add computed columns that use SQL to compute values on a column level.
6. Establish relationships to other Core entities for better documentation or generation of SK columns (if applicable).
7. Apply filtering to the Core entity as necessary.

### Step 6: [Generating](../generator/generator.md) Code

1. After maintaining the Core entity, generate DDL/DML and potentially ETL/Orchestration jobs based on the defined Raw, Stage, and Core entity definitions.
2. Generate output using the Jinja2-templates.
