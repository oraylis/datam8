# STAGE Zone Documentation

## Overview

The **STAGE** zone in the _DataM8_ data model plays a crucial role in validating table columns and data types. It acts as a checkpoint to ensure that records adhere to predefined definitions in the _DataM8_ solution. Records that fail to meet these criteria may be redirected to a poison table for further review or handling.

## Entity Definition

Based on the JSON sample, entities within the STAGE zone are structured with key components:

- **Data Module:** Defines the module within the STAGE zone.
- **Data Product:** Indicates the data product associated with the entity.
- **Name & Display Name:** The technical and user-friendly names of the entity.
- **Attributes:** A list of attributes for the entity, each defined with type, length, and nullability.

## Function Definition

The function of the STAGE zone, as illustrated in the JSON sample, includes:

- **Data Source:** Identifies the source from which data is being staged. In the sample, this is marked as "__meta__."
- **Source Location:** Specifies the original location of the data, such as "raw/Sales/Customer/CustomerAddress" in the sample.
- **Attribute Mapping:** Details the mapping process between source and target attributes to ensure data consistency and accuracy.

### Detailed Function Mapping

Function mapping in the STAGE zone involves aligning source data attributes with their corresponding target attributes in the staging process. This ensures that data is correctly transferred and transformed for validation and further processing.
